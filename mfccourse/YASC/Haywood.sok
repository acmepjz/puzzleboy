SokEvo and SokHard puzzles generated using SokEvo
Author: Lee J Haywood
Original website: http://fruise.googlepages.com/sokoban.html
Collection: Haywood

This collection of Sokoban puzzles was generated by a program written by Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and Brian Damgaard's YASGen program to 'evolve' them.
The puzzles in the collection may be freely distributed and may be used commercially provided that they remain unchanged and I am credited with my name - Lee J Haywood.  Any similarity to anyone else's work is entirely coincidental and unintentional.
The puzzles may be included with any program under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later, with the following restrictions (see the Additional Terms section of the GPL).
(1) A copy of this text must be included with the program, and also with all derivatives of that program which include any of the puzzles.
(2) Misrepresentation of the origin of the puzzles is prohibited, and modified versions must be marked as such.

Author's notes:

The SokEvo puzzles are sorted by the length of their shortest solutions, which is intended to be an objective way of ordering them from easiest to hardest.  Your abilities are likely to mean that some seem to be out of place, however.  Also, some puzzles have more solutions than others so may be easier as a result. The later puzzles are extremely difficult.

The SokHard puzzles are sorted in release order.

This collection of Sokoban puzzles was generated by a program written by Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and Brian Damgaard's YASGen program to 'evolve' them.
The puzzles in the collection may be freely distributed and may be used commercially provided that they remain unchanged and I am credited with my name - Lee J Haywood.  Any similarity to anyone else's work is entirely coincidental and unintentional.
The puzzles may be included with any program under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later, with the following restrictions (see the Additional Terms section of the GPL).
(1) A copy of this text must be included with the program, and also with all derivatives of that program which include any of the puzzles.
(2) Misrepresentation of the origin of the puzzles is prohibited, and modified versions must be marked as such.

Author's note:
The SokEvo puzzles are sorted by the length of their shortest solutions, which is intended to be an objective way of ordering them from easiest to hardest.  Your abilities are likely to mean that some seem to be out of place, however.  Also, some puzzles have more solutions than others so may be easier as a result. The later puzzles are extremely difficult.

Your abilities are likely to mean that some seem to be out of place, however.  Also, some puzzles have more solutions than others so may be easier as a result. The later puzzles are extremely difficult.

The SokEvo puzzles are sorted by the length of their shortest solutions, which is intended to be an objective way of ordering them from easiest to hardest.  Your abilities are likely to mean that some seem to be out of place, however.  Also, some puzzles have more solutions than others so may be easier as a result. The later puzzles are extremely difficult.

This collection of Sokoban puzzles was generated by a program written by Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and Brian Damgaard's YASGen program to 'evolve' them.
The puzzles in the collection may be freely distributed and may be used commercially provided that they remain unchanged and I am credited with my name - Lee J Haywood.  Any similarity to anyone else's work is entirely coincidental and unintentional.
The puzzles may be included with any program under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later, with the following restrictions (see the Additional Terms section of the GPL).
(1) A copy of this text must be included with the program, and also with all derivatives of that program which include any of the puzzles.
(2) Misrepresentation of the origin of the puzzles is prohibited, and modified versions must be marked as such.

Author's note:
The SokEvo puzzles are sorted by the length of their shortest solutions, which is intended to be an objective way of ordering them from easiest to hardest.  Your abilities are likely to mean that some seem to be out of place, however.  Also, some puzzles have more solutions than others so may be easier as a result. The later puzzles are extremely difficult.

The puzzles in the collection may be freely distributed and may be used commercially provided that they remain unchanged and I am credited with my name - Lee J Haywood.  Any similarity to anyone else's work is entirely coincidental and unintentional.
The puzzles may be included with any program under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later, with the following restrictions (see the Additional Terms section of the GPL).
(1) A copy of this text must be included with the program, and also with all derivatives of that program which include any of the puzzles.
(2) Misrepresentation of the origin of the puzzles is prohibited, and modified versions must be marked as such.

Author's note:
The SokEvo puzzles are sorted by the length of their shortest solutions, which is intended to be an objective way of ordering them from easiest to hardest.  Your abilities are likely to mean that some seem to be out of place, however.  Also, some puzzles have more solutions than others so may be easier as a result. The later puzzles are extremely difficult.

This collection of Sokoban puzzles was generated by a program written by Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and Brian Damgaard's YASGen program to 'evolve' them.
The puzzles in the collection may be freely distributed and may be used commercially provided that they remain unchanged and I am credited with my name - Lee J Haywood.  Any similarity to anyone else's work is entirely coincidental and unintentional.
The puzzles may be included with any program under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later, with the following restrictions (see the Additional Terms section of the GPL).
(1) A copy of this text must be included with the program, and also with all derivatives of that program which include any of the puzzles.
(2) Misrepresentation of the origin of the puzzles is prohibited, and modified versions must be marked as such.

Author's note:
The SokEvo puzzles are sorted by the length of their shortest solutions, which is intended to be an objective way of ordering them from easiest to hardest.  Your abilities are likely to mean that some seem to be out of place, however.  Also, some puzzles have more solutions than others so may be easier as a result. The later puzzles are extremely difficult.

Note:
At the time of writing, "Teresa" is the longest known 5x5 level, counting pushes. An exhaustive analysis of all 256585 levels with 9 boxes and no interior walls has proved all other levels of this type to be shorter. It is not known whether other types of 5x5 levels can reach the same number of pushes. - Brian Damgaard

This collection of Sokoban puzzles was generated by a program written by Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and Brian Damgaard's YASGen program to 'evolve' them.
The puzzles in the collection may be freely distributed and may be used commercially provided that they remain unchanged and I am credited with my name - Lee J Haywood.  Any similarity to anyone else's work is entirely coincidental and unintentional.
The puzzles may be included with any program under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later, with the following restrictions (see the Additional Terms section of the GPL).
(1) A copy of this text must be included with the program, and also with all derivatives of that program which include any of the puzzles.
(2) Misrepresentation of the origin of the puzzles is prohibited, and modified versions must be marked as such.

This collection of Sokoban puzzles was generated by a program written by Lee J Haywood that used random numbers and Brian Damgaard's YASGen program to 'evolve' them.
The puzzles in the collection may be freely distributed and may be used commercially provided that they remain unchanged and I am credited with my name - Lee J Haywood.  Any similarity to anyone else's work is entirely coincidental and unintentional.
The puzzles may be included with any program under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or later, with the following restrictions (see the Additional Terms section of the GPL).
